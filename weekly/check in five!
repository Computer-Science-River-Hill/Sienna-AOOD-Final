 - Spent some time thinking about normalizing the function. For example, with dataframes, they turned out to be more like normal arrays where I could set the values equal to one another, which was interesting. Furthermore, I read some articles on stack overflow about a future error and an int64 error. Here are the couple of sites I looked at: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-search-and-replace-text-in-a-file-in-python/ and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77185621/setting-an-item-of-incompatible-dtype-is-deprecated-and-will-raise-in-a-future-e and https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_dataframes.asp

Friday
- Worked on uploading the file I want to change to my notebook, which turned out to be harder than I thought it was going to be... https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-upload-a-dataset-in-jupyter-notebook/ and https://hackernoon.com/how-to-read-text-file-in-python kind of saved my life. ALso got a super weird error regarding unicode, but this guy https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37400974/error-unicode-error-unicodeescape-codec-cant-decode-bytes-in-position-2-3 on stack overflow solved the error. Now I have an error regarding not finding the directory or path, as if its incorrect, but I plan to use the file I uploaded to Jupyter Notebook hub?
