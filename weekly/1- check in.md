Monday 
 - Worked on setting up the game and considering where I'm going to write my code. Began reading through the Dash and Plotly tutorials, the packages that I think will help me create my graph. Considered if I should jump straight into those graphs or write basic opening code. I looked at the terminal but that wasn't helpful. I started working to create this GitHub assignment. 

 Tuesday 
 - Opened up PyCharm on my computer as a way to code, except it gave me an exception like your group won't let you run this. I also created the GitHub assignment and began installing dash on my PyCharm program, though I still am not able to run it because of the error it was giving me. Considered coding in Replit, but that seems most undesirable so I'll just keep reading the tutorials.
