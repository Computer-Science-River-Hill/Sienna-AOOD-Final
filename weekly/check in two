Monday 
 - Worked on learning more about installing Dash and Plotly. Started installing Anaconda on my personal computer, since I feel like that will be useful in the future. I also worked on using Colab.google to start my code, exploring and learning about installing packages and such. You submitted a request to stop the error appearing in PyCharm about the group organization.

Tuesday
- Looked over Dash and Plotly tutorials until I understood them fully. Began Anaconda set up on my personal computer. Also studied Colab on this laptop.

Wednesday
- Continued to review Dash and Plotly. Am waiting on signatures so that I can succesfully install the packages onto PyCharm to begin my work. Read about the subleties between Python and language used to call Dash and Plotly.
