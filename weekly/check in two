Overall purpose of the code written and which files were modified.

Monday 
 - Worked on learning more about installing Dash and Plotly. Started installing Anaconda on my personal computer, since I feel like that will be useful in the future. I also worked on using Colab.google to start my code, exploring and learning about installing packages and such. You submitted a request to stop the error appearing in PyCharm about the group organization.

Tuesday
- Looked over Dash and Plotly tutorials until I understood them fully. Began Anaconda set up on my personal computer. Also studied Colab on this laptop.

Wednesday
- Continued to review Dash and Plotly. Am waiting on signatures so that I can succesfully install the packages onto PyCharm to begin my work. Read about the subleties between Python and language used to call Dash and Plotly.

Thursday
- Waited patiently for the packages to be installed properly. Looked at things about Anaconda and downloads and implementation for later use. 

Friday
- Worked on understanding the layout of Anaconda that I have downloaded onto my personal computer. It looks a lot different than github or replit, so it is taking some getting used to. Also, worked on installing the packages onto the app of Anaconda.
