Research performed to incldue the URL of the information found.
Overall purpose of the code written and which files were modified.

Monday 
 - I realized some stuff I did last week was on the right track, but totally wrong! Because of this, I cannot begin until I have properly installed the kernel with dash and plotly on it. I had also lost the kernel folder I had successfully created last week, and I'm not sure where it went. So, I spent my time re-watching the videos that I now know more about and re-creating the folders and I finally made it work!
Tuesday
- Finally discovered the kernel that I needed so that I can begin writing code. Read through the basic tutorial of Dash (https://dash.plotly.com/layout) and then started to read through the more detailed parts of writing the app. Was able to put some code down on the paper and decide how I want to change my graph so that it's different than just the fundamentals. Tomorrow I plan on gathering data in a spreadsheet so I can graph my own data. Put some code in the github coede respository.
