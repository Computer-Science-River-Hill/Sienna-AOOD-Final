Weekly Check-in Two
For each daily incldue the following information in the check-in:

Research performed to incldue the URL of the information found.
Overall purpose of the code written and which files were modified.

Monday 
 - I realized some stuff I did last week was on the right track, but totally wrong! Because of this, I cannot begin until I have properly installed the kernel with dash and plotly on it. I had also lost the kernel folder I had successfully created last week, and I'm not sure where it went. So, I spent my time re-watching the videos that I now know more about and re-creating the folders and I finally made it work!
Tuesday
- Finally discovered the kernel that I needed so that I can begin writing code. Read through the basic tutorial of Dash (https://dash.plotly.com/layout) and then started to read through the more detailed parts of writing the app. Was able to put some code down on the paper and decide how I want to change my graph so that it's different than just the fundamentals. Tomorrow I plan on gathering data in a spreadsheet so I can graph my own data. Put some code in the github coede respository.

Wednesday
 - I began setting up so I could learn the math! Read about the process to install more packages in case I need them (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75388232/install-python-package-inside-a-jupyter-notebook-kernel). Hopefully I won't have to create a whole new kernel. Also read about typical normalization for a constant under the plotly graphing tool (https://plotly.com/python/v3/normalization/) and built in commands that exist. Since I want to normalize for an external variable, I will have to consider different methods for normalizing for a changing variable.
