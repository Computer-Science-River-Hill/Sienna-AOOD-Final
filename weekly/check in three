Weekly Check-in Two
For each daily incldue the following information in the check-in:

Research performed to incldue the URL of the information found.
Overall purpose of the code written and which files were modified.

Monday 
 - Slow start to the week. Checked to see if the permissions were updated in PyCharm on this computer (they were not). Tomorrow's step is to figure out why the HTML is not loading on the Jupter Notebook. Today, I imported a "simple dash app" to see if that would let me begin the process of coding, but instead it gave me a 127.0.0.1 error that is local to my computer. Even a simpler dash app seems to not work.... https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ This site also helped me understand how the notebooks actually work.
Tuesday
- Absent
Wednesday
 - Worked on installing a new kernel which would then include the packages dash & plotly, since they are not included on the other kernel. Why isn't the kernel I installed yesterday showing up when I go to select a kernel? I tried to reinstall to get the basic notebook setup so I could follow along with the YouTube video. A couple screenshots provided. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClTWPoDHY_s&ab_channel=Abstractprogrammer. This youtube video helped me understand installing jupyter notebooks using the command prompt window.
Thursday
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5QtTLvjNBE&ab_channel=TheCodeCity. This video helped me finally install the proper kernel using the desktop folder I had. Now, the jupyter notebook shows the DashPlotly folder I created with the kernels within it, and therefore I can move onto coding the kernels themselves to include the packages Dash and Plotly.
